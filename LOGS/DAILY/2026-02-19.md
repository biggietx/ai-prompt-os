## OBJ-001 — Initial Prompt OS scaffold

**What I did today:**
- Created the foundational repository structure with 7 governed prompts (P00 Context Lock, P01 Scope Declaration, P03 Design Gate, P05 Constrained Builder, P06 Verify Forensics, P07 Adversarial Review, P08 Governance Escalation).
- Wrote ADR-001 documenting gate-mirrored structure, separation of duties, stop conditions, and vendor neutrality.
- Created README.md with 60-second usage guide, contribution rules, and versioning policy.
- Created CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE (MIT, ServiceMark.ai).

**Progress vs success metric:**
All 7 prompt files created with full YAML headers. ADR, README, CHANGELOG, LICENSE in place. Tagged v0.1.0. 11 files, 565 insertions. **100% complete.**

**Artifacts / links:**
- PR: direct commit to main (initial scaffold)
- Tag: `v0.1.0` (commit `137fa67`)
- Key files: `prompts/`, `adr/ADR-001-initial-structure.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`

**Next steps:**
- Add machine-readable prompt registry
- Add lint enforcement
- Add team playbook

**Risks / blockers:** None.

**Confidence:** 100%

## OBJ-002 — Prompt registry + lint enforcement

**What I did today:**
- Created `prompts.index.json` — machine-readable registry listing all 7 prompts with metadata.
- Created `scripts/lint_prompts.sh` — validates YAML headers, required keys, secret patterns, absolute paths across all prompt files.
- Created `playbooks/01_governed_session.md` — 10-minute governed session checklist with PR requirements.
- Created ADR-002 explaining registry and lint decisions.
- Updated README with Repo Contract, Automation, and Version Pinning sections.
- Updated CHANGELOG with v0.2.0 entry.
- Fixed Bash 3.x compatibility (replaced `mapfile` with `while read` loop).

**Progress vs success metric:**
Registry created. Lint passes all 7 files with `[PASS]`. Playbook complete. **100% complete.**

**Artifacts / links:**
- PR: direct commit to main
- Tag: `v0.2.0` (commit `43dfb22`)
- Key files: `prompts.index.json`, `scripts/lint_prompts.sh`, `playbooks/01_governed_session.md`, `adr/ADR-002-prompt-registry-and-lint.md`

**Next steps:**
- Add session recording system
- Add pre-commit hooks
- Add CI check script

**Risks / blockers:** None.

**Confidence:** 100%

## OBJ-003 — Session recording + CI integration

**What I did today:**
- Created `session/record_session.sh` — CLI session recorder with `--prompts`, `--developer`, `--target-repo`, `--notes` arguments. Auto-detects version from git tag. Lint-gated (aborts if lint fails). Outputs JSON to `session/logs/`.
- Created `session/schema_prompt_session.json` — JSON schema for session logs.
- Created `.git-hooks/pre-commit` — runs lint before every commit, blocks on failure.
- Created `scripts/install_hooks.sh` — manual hook installer (opt-in, not auto-installed).
- Created `scripts/ci_check.sh` — validates lint, registry JSON structure, and registry-to-file correspondence.
- Created ADR-003 documenting session recording and enforcement decisions.
- Updated CHANGELOG with v0.3.0 entry.

**Progress vs success metric:**
Session recorder produces valid JSON. Pre-commit hook blocks on lint failure. CI check passes all steps. **100% complete.**

**Artifacts / links:**
- PR: direct commit to main
- Tag: `v0.3.0` (commit `4acfbed`)
- Key files: `session/record_session.sh`, `session/schema_prompt_session.json`, `.git-hooks/pre-commit`, `scripts/install_hooks.sh`, `scripts/ci_check.sh`, `adr/ADR-003-session-recording-and-enforcement.md`

**Next steps:**
- Build CLI wrapper to consolidate workflow
- Define orchestrator integration contract
- Add artifact export mechanism

**Risks / blockers:** None.

**Confidence:** 100%
